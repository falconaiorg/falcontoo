## Side-thoughts

- ### On Pricing
  - People don't read articles that often. So I might have to rethink the pricing. I can later release it for books and give it as an add-on or even at the same price if the models keep getting cheaper.
- ### There is a lot of click-bait
  - Can I do somthing that tells me if I sould read an article or not.
  - I mean personal rotten tomatoes for the articles based on my preferences.
- ### Relection
  - I think I could add a special feature about relfection, where I could use AI to help people reflect after they have read an article.
  - However I think this could only work in audio mode. Its very difficult to type so much when you reflect.
- ### Chrome Tabs
  - Two people at this point have mentiond that they just use bookmarks.
- ### Reading Assistant/Manager
  - Maybe people don't need a reader that much, but instead need a reading assistant or a manager. I mean a butler that helps them be more efficent.
- ### Social Aspect of Articles
  - People may share article as a social currency, ie they might share it with others.
- ### About Me
  - An about me section along with domains that I am interested in may also be a useful thing to implement.

## Risks

- People don't think to much about articles
- How many people will pay for this reader?
  - Superhuman is a B2B product, this is not.
